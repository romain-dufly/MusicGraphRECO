# Music graph-based Recommender

Graphs provide a powerful framework for representing and analyzing the
connections and relationships between music artists. In this project, we
explore the application of graphs and knowledge bases to study the closeness
between artists using three approaches: collaborations, co-occurrences in
playlists, and shared attributes like music genre and nationality.

In todayâ€™s digital era, the motivation behind building such graphs is clear: to
empower auto-generated playlists and recommender systems with a deeper
understanding of music preferences, enabling personalized and tailored
recommendations for listeners.
